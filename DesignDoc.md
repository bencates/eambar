remote xenoarchaeology base. They were studying the remains of an ancient alien
crash site. Your ship has arrived to investigate, render aid, and recover
anything of value.

## Story Progression

### Act 1: Your ship

You begin the game in the maintenance airlock having just completed some routine
repairs only to discover that something has gone horribly wrong while you were
outside the ship. Most of the crew have been infected with an alien virus
turning them into mindless hyper-aggressive space zombies, and there are
similarly hostile alien hatchlings scattered around the ship.

You quickly learn that the rest of the survivors are regrouping in a shuttle bay
several decks away from your location. You'll have to fight through the infected
to reach them.

### Act 2: Xenoarchaeology base and crashed alien ship

You take a shuttle down to the xenoarchaeology base on the planet's surface. You
make your way through the base and into the remains of the alien wreck, fighting
more infected, local wildlife, and an increasing variety of aliens.

Upon reaching the wreck's bridge you meet the ship's AI. You learn that it's crew had also succumbed to the same infection. Most of them entered cryostasis in a failed attempt to prevent them from succumbing. The archaeology team accidentally

## Game Mechanics

### Equipment

Melee weapons are

Your EV suit protects you from the infection and empowers you to fight back. It
can be upgraded substantially over the course of a run. The suit serves as your
armor and it's durability serves as your HP pool. It can also be equipped with a
shield and a limited number of mod slots.

Shields provide an additional health pool which absorbs incoming damage before
it is applied to your suit. Shileds recharge automatically when not taking
damage, though they may take several turns to begin recharging once broken.

Mods provide passive bonuses while they are equipped.

### Consumables

- Repair kits restore the suit's durability.
- Batteries restore a shield or recharge a ranged weapon.
- Grenades do AOE damage and possibly other effects.

### Nanites

Nanites serve as the in game XP and currency system. They can be acquired and
spent in several different ways.

- Caches of nanites can be dropped by enemies or found on the map.
- Repair stations consume nanites to repair your suit's durability.
- Recharge stations consume nanites to refill the charges on ranged weapons and
  other limited use items.
- Recycle stations consume unwanted items and transform them into nanites.
- Upgrade stations consume nanites to permanently upgrade your weapons and suit.

Stations have a chance to spawn randomly on the map. In addition, the safe areas
at the end of each act will have one of each kind of station in them.

### Weapon upgrades

Weapon upgrades provide a flat bonus to damage. In addition, ranged weapons have
upgraded charge capacity. There is a small chance for items to spawn with
upgrades already applied. Upgrading a weapon increases it's recycle value by
some percentage of the upgrade cost.

### Suit upgrades

- Increase durability
- Increase armor
- Bonus to melee damage ("upgrade servo motors")
- Bonus to ranged damege ("upgrade targeting AI")
- Additional mod slots

### Ship

"Office tower" style ship, hexagonal cross-section.

Each floor is a hexagon of radius 25. Floors are 4m tall, hexes are 1m.
